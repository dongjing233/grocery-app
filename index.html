    <h2>OverView</h2>
    <p>FreshBuy provides users with an accessible and flexible online grocery shopping experience. The aim of this app is to eliminate the waste of food, simplify the operation, and avoid buying the wrong product and quantity. The app concretizes the actual size of the product base on the users’ eating habits, makes it easier for users to repurchase a product by scanning barcodes, and use repetition and emphasis to make sure the details of the purchase are correct.</p>

    <h2>Painpoints</h2>
    <p>My users are seeking a clear and enjoyable shopping environment which can provide them with a good shopping experience. When doing shopping, my users would like to hear the comments and feedback from other people who have used the product before. They need to know if the actual functionality and user experience reach their expectations, and they want to avoid buying products with unacceptable shortcomings.</p>

    <h2>Persona</h2>
    <p>Age:20-60</p>
    <p>Gender: female</p>
      <p>interests and hobbies: movies, music, handicrafts, food</p>
        <p> shopping frequency: once a week</p>
          <p>needs: quick and on-time delivery, fresh food, don’t waste money on things they don’t need</p>
            <p> wants: a clean and enjoyable shopping environment, good shopping experience, reading reviews from other people, get an idea of the size of the products</p>
      

    <h2>Value Proposition</h2>
    <p><b>Efficiency:</b> Finding a specific product is one of the most important goals. In this app, users have multiple options to find the product base on their personal situation. They can go into specific categories, search for the name of the product, or scan the barcode of the product they already own.</p>
    <p><b>Wayfinding:</b>Users can click on the navigation bar on the bottom to switch between different sections.</p>
    <p><b>Affordance:</b>Real-time feedback and long-term feedback are equally important. Onclick events and hover events make it easier for users to navigate on the interface and highlight their selection to avoid mistakes.</p>
    <p><b>Feedback:</b>Base on the input of user information, I visualized the estimated consumption time of grocery and the quantity of food saved by concretizes the actual size.
    </p>
    <p><b>Hierarchy:</b>The product information page needs to include a huge amount of content. After listening to the feedback from the user test, I was more aware of the existing problems so I changed the spacings between elements, replaced the text with visual elements, and adjust the font size and color to create more contrast.</p>
    <div id="userjourney"></div>
    <p><b>Aesthetics:</b>I create the color scheme base on users’ aims and demands for grocery shopping. Fruits, vegetables, and snacks always remind me of freshness and a healthy lifestyle. For the display font, I choose to use Futura. Sans-serif is more readable on small screens and conveys a sense of modern and efficient.</p>
